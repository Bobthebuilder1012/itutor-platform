## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

**If you're the new CTO and need to get up to speed fast:**

### Day 1: Understand the Platform
- [ ] Read **[CTO_HANDOVER.md](./CTO_HANDOVER.md)** (comprehensive overview)
- [ ] Skim **[SCHEMA_SUMMARY.md](../src/supabase/SCHEMA_SUMMARY.md)** (data model)
- [ ] Review **[FLOW_SUMMARY.md](../src/supabase/FLOW_SUMMARY.md)** (key user flows)

### Day 2: Set Up Local Environment
- [ ] Follow **[RUNBOOK.md](./RUNBOOK.md)** → Local Development Setup
- [ ] Clone repo, install dependencies
- [ ] Get Supabase credentials, create `.env.local`
- [ ] Run `npm run dev` and verify app loads

### Day 3: Explore the Codebase
- [ ] Review key API routes in `app/api/`:
  - `payments/wipay/webhook/route.ts` (payment processing)
  - `cron/process-charges/route.ts` (scheduled jobs)
  - `tutor/verification/upload/route.ts` (file uploads)
  - `admin/verification/requests/[id]/approve/route.ts` (admin workflows)
- [ ] Check Vercel Dashboard (deployments, cron logs)
- [ ] Check Supabase Dashboard (database, auth, storage)

### Week 1: Deploy a Small Change
- [ ] Make a minor UI change (e.g., text update)
- [ ] Test locally: `npm run build && npm run dev`
- [ ] Commit and push to `main`: `git push origin main`
- [ ] Monitor Vercel auto-deploy
- [ ] Verify change in production

### Week 2: Plan Improvements
- [ ] Review "Future Roadmap & Scaling" in **[CTO_HANDOVER.md](./CTO_HANDOVER.md)**
- [ ] Identify technical debt priorities (CI/CD, testing, migration automation)
- [ ] Plan team onboarding if expanding beyond solo development
