========================================
QUICK FIX: Apply This SQL to Supabase
========================================

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/nfkrfciozjxrodkusrhh/sql/new

2. Copy EVERYTHING from FIX_TIMEZONE_AVAILABILITY.sql and paste it into the SQL editor

3. Click "Run" (or press Ctrl+Enter)

4. You should see: "Success. No rows returned"

5. Refresh your browser where the tutor calendar is showing

6. The times should now match!

========================================

WHAT THIS DOES:
- Fixes the timezone conversion bug
- Tutors entering "9:00 AM - 5:00 PM" will now show as "9:00 AM - 5:00 PM" to students
- Before: Times were treated as UTC and converted (4 hour offset)
- After: Times are treated as Trinidad time (correct)

========================================
